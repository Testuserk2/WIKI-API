# 分页查询优化
## 原Sql:

<code> SELECT  T.Uid , T.CreateName , T.CreateTime , T.IP , T.Action , T.Message , T.LogType , T.DataUid , T.SumCount                       FROM  
(  SELECT    AL.Uid ,    AL.CreateName ,    AL.CreateTime ,    AL.IP ,    AL.Action ,    AL.Message ,    AL.LogType ,    AL.DataUid ,    U.UserType ,    ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( ORDER BY CreateTime DESC ) AS RowNumber ,   
 ( COUNT(AL.Uid) OVER ( ) ) AS SumCount                        FROM      TAlm_AdminLog AS AL WITH ( NOLOCK )  
  JOIN Alm.dbo.TAlm_User AS U WITH ( NOLOCK ) ON AL.CreateName = U.Name  COLLATE Chinese_PRC_CI_AS  AND AL.CreateName<>'system'  AND U.UserType  NOT IN (4,1,2)  )  as T where T.RowNumber between  1 and  50  </code>
### 执行情况:
<code>(50 行受影响)

## 第一次优化
* 去掉总页数查询,单独实现

<code>SELECT  T.Uid , T.CreateName , T.CreateTime , T.IP , T.Action , T.Message , T.LogType , T.DataUid                       FROM  (  SELECT    AL.Uid ,    AL.CreateName ,    AL.CreateTime ,    AL.IP ,    AL.Action ,    AL.Message ,    AL.LogType ,    AL.DataUid ,    U.UserType ,    ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( ORDER BY CreateTime DESC ) AS RowNumber                     FROM      TAlm_AdminLog AS AL WITH ( NOLOCK )    JOIN Alm.dbo.TAlm_User AS U WITH ( NOLOCK ) ON AL.CreateName = U.Name  COLLATE Chinese_PRC_CI_AS  AND AL.CreateName<>'system'  AND U.UserType  NOT IN (4,1,2)  )  as T where T.RowNumber between  1 and  50  
</code>
###执行情况
<code>
SQL Server parse and compile time: 
   CPU time = 5 ms, elapsed time = 5 ms.

## 第二次优化:
* 排序语句只包含UID

<code>
SELECT  T.Uid , T.CreateName , T.CreateTime , T.IP , T.Action , T.Message , T.LogType , T.DataUid                    FROM  
TAlm_AdminLog as t with(nolock)  where t.Uid in(select  Uid from (  SELECT    AL.Uid ,      ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( ORDER BY AL.CreateTime DESC ) AS RowNumber    
                        FROM      TAlm_AdminLog AS AL WITH ( NOLOCK )  
  JOIN Alm.dbo.TAlm_User AS U WITH ( NOLOCK ) ON AL.CreateName = U.Name  COLLATE Chinese_PRC_CI_AS  AND AL.CreateName<>'system'  AND U.UserType  NOT IN (4,1,2)  )   as T1 where  T1.RowNumber between  1 and  50 ) 
</code>
### 执行情况:
<code>

</code>

## 第三次优化
* 排序由CreateTime变为Uid

<code>
SELECT  T.Uid , T.CreateName , T.CreateTime , T.IP , T.Action , T.Message , T.LogType , T.DataUid                    FROM  
TAlm_AdminLog as t with(nolock)  where t.Uid in(select  Uid from (  SELECT    AL.Uid ,      ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( ORDER BY AL.uid DESC ) AS RowNumber    
                        FROM      TAlm_AdminLog AS AL WITH ( NOLOCK )  
  JOIN Alm.dbo.TAlm_User AS U WITH ( NOLOCK ) ON AL.CreateName = U.Name  COLLATE Chinese_PRC_CI_AS  AND AL.CreateName<>'system'  AND U.UserType  NOT IN (4,1,2)  )   as T1 where  T1.RowNumber between  1 and  50 ) 
</code>

### 执行情况:
<code>
(50 行受影响)
Table 'TAlm_AdminLog'. Scan count 1, logical reads 166, physical reads 0, read-ahead reads 0, lob logical reads 0, lob physical reads 0, lob read-ahead reads 0.
Table 'TAlm_User'. Scan count 50, logical reads 209, physical reads 0, read-ahead reads 0, lob logical reads 0, lob physical reads 0, lob read-ahead reads 0.

 SQL Server Execution Times:

SQL Server parse and compile time: 
   CPU time = 0 ms, elapsed time = 0 ms.

 SQL Server Execution Times:
   CPU time = 0 ms,  elapsed time = 0 ms.

</code>

##总结:
* 聚合数据(如总数)不应该在每条语句执行一次
* 分页排序时应该选择最少字段
* 排序时尽量使用最有效字段(如主键,索引字段,整形效率最高)
